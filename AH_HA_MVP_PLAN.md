# Ah-ha MVP Plan

## 1. Product Overview

*   **Product Name:** Ah-ha
*   **MVP Demo Goal:** Demonstrate how "Ah-ha" transforms fleeting AI chat insights into easily retrievable, valuable knowledge assets, solving the "lost in the noise" problem.

## 2. Core Value Proposition for Executives

*   **Stop Losing Valuable Insights:** Prevents critical information, ideas, and solutions generated by AI from being forgotten or difficult to find.
*   **Boost Productivity & Efficiency:** Saves time otherwise spent scrolling through old chats or re-generating information.
*   **Maximize AI ROI:** Ensures the valuable outputs from AI interactions are retained and reusable, increasing the return on investment in AI tools.

## 3. MVP Key Features

### 3.1. Simplified Chat Interface (Mocked)

    *   **Purpose:** Visually represent the "problem space" – a typical AI chat where valuable info gets buried.
    *   **Functionality:** Display a pre-populated, short-to-medium length AI conversation. (No actual AI interaction needed for MVP).
    *   **Demo Highlight:** Show this is where valuable info often gets buried.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   [X] Design the basic layout for the chat interface.
        *   [X] Create mock chat message components (user and AI).
        *   [X] Populate the interface with pre-defined mock chat data (from backend or hardcoded in frontend).
        *   [X] Style the chat interface to look like a typical AI chat.

### 3.2. "Capture Ah-ha" Button/Action

    *   **Purpose:** The core interaction – saving the valuable snippet.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   User can select a piece of text within the mocked chat interface.
        *   A prominent "Capture to Ah-ha" button (or right-click context menu option) appears.
        *   Clicking it opens a tiny modal asking for a Title for the "Ah-ha" (required) and optional simple Tags (e.g., comma-separated).
    *   **Demo Highlight:** Show how quick and effortless it is to grab just the important part.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   [X] Implement text selection detection in the chat interface.
        *   [X] Design and implement the "Capture to Ah-ha" button/context menu.
        *   [X] Create the "Save Ah-ha" modal with fields for Title (required) and Tags (optional).
        *   [X] Implement logic to extract selected text.
        *   [X] Implement the "Save Ah-ha" action to send data (title, tags, selected content, original context) to the backend.

### 3.3. "My Ah-ha's" Library (Simplified View)

    *   **Purpose:** Show where saved snippets are organized and easily accessible.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   A separate, clean view listing saved "Ah-ha's."
        *   Each entry displays its Title, Tags, a preview of the Snippet Content, and a Timestamp.
        *   The newest "Ah-ha" appears at the top.
    *   **Demo Highlight:** Contrast this organized view with the messy chat log.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   [X] Design the layout for the "My Ah-ha's" library view.
        *   [X] Create a component to display individual "Ah-ha" cards (Title, Tags, Snippet Preview, Timestamp).
        *   [X] Implement logic to fetch all "Ah-ha's" from the backend.
        *   [X] Display "Ah-ha's" in the library, newest first.
        *   [X] Style the library for a clean, organized look.

### 3.4. Basic Keyword Search within "My Ah-ha's"

    *   **Purpose:** Demonstrate easy retrieval.
    *   **Functionality:** A simple search bar that filters the "My Ah-ha's" list based on keywords found in Titles, Tags, or Snippet Content.
    *   **Demo Highlight:** Show finding a specific "Ah-ha" in seconds.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   [X] Add a search bar input field to the "My Ah-ha's" library view.
        *   [X] Implement frontend logic to filter displayed "Ah-ha's" based on search term (client-side filtering for MVP).
        *   [X] OR: Implement backend endpoint to search "Ah-ha's" and update frontend to use it.

### 3.5. Link to Original Context (Simplified)

    *   **Purpose:** Show that context isn't lost, addressing a core principle.
    *   **Functionality:** Each "Ah-ha" in the library has a "View Context" link. Clicking it (for the demo) could simply highlight or re-display the original full message from which the snippet was taken (within the mocked chat view or a modal).
    *   **Demo Highlight:** Assure them that the broader context is still available if needed.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   [X] Add a "View Context" link/button to each "Ah-ha" card.
        *   [X] Implement functionality to display the original context (e.g., in a modal, or by navigating/highlighting in the mock chat view).
        *   [X] Ensure the original context is stored and retrieved correctly with each "Ah-ha".

## 4. MVP Demo Flow (The "Catchy" Story - under 3-5 minutes)

1.  **Scene Setting:**
    *   Show a typical, slightly cluttered (mocked) AI chat interface.

*   **Backend/Data Storage:** Python/FastAPI with an in-memory database (Pydantic models).
*   [X] Basic FastAPI app setup.
*   [X] Pydantic models for `AhHaSnippet`.
*   [X] Endpoints for:
    *[X] `POST /ah-has/` (Create Ah-ha)

*   [ ] Implement CORS if frontend and backend are on different ports during development.
*   **Focus:** UI/UX slickness and clarity of the demo flow.
